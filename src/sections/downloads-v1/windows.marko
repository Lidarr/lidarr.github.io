  <install-step title="Introduction">
    <p>Lidarr is supported natively on Windows. Lidarr can be installed on Windows as Windows Service or system tray application.</p>
    <p>
      A Windows Service runs even when the user is not logged in, but special care must be taken since Windows Services cannot access network drives (X:\ mapped drives) without special configuration steps.<br/>
      Additionally the Windows Service runs under the 'Local Service' account, by default this account does not have permissions to access your user's home directory unless permissions have been assigned manually. This is particularly relevant when using download clients that are configured to download to your home directory.<br/>
      It's therefore advisable to install Lidarr as a system tray application if the user can remain logged in. The option to do so is provided during the installer.

      Windows versions are limited for support to those currently supported by Microsoft, others may work but this is an unsupported configuration.
